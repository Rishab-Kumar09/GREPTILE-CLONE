1. **Login Flow**: Users submit credentials to \`/api/auth/login\`
2. **Token Generation**: Server validates credentials and generates a JWT token
3. **Token Storage**: Client stores the token (typically in localStorage or httpOnly cookies)
4. **Protected Routes**: Middleware validates tokens on protected endpoints
5. **User Context**: Decoded token provides user information throughout the app

**Security Recommendations:**
- Use httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage for token storage
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Add rate limiting to login endpoints
- Consider implementing 2FA for sensitive applications

Would you like me to review your specific authentication implementation?`

**Current Setup:**
- Using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Well-structured schema with proper relationships
- Good indexing on frequently queried columns

**Performance Optimization Suggestions:**
1. Add composite indexes on \`(user_id, created_at)\` for faster user-specific queries
2. Consider implementing database connection pooling
3. Use database migrations for schema changes
4. Implement query optimization for complex joins

**Security Best Practices:**
- Always use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this automatically)
- Implement proper access controls at the database level
- Regular backups and point-in-time recovery setup
- Monitor slow queries and optimize them

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **Memory Leak Risk**: Event listeners in React components not properly cleaned up
2. **Race Condition**: Async state updates without proper dependency arrays
3. **Security Vulnerability**: User input not sanitized in search functionality

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Add cleanup functions in useEffect hooks
2. Use useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
3. Implement input validation and sanitization

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Add TypeScript strict mode for better type safety
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling

Would you like me to provide specific code examples for any of these fixes?`

**Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**
1. **Bundle Size**: Large JavaScript bundles affecting load time
2. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Components re-rendering without prop changes
3. **Database Queries**: N+1 query problems in some endpoints
4. **Image Loading**: Unoptimized images causing slow page loads

**Optimization Recommendations:**
1. **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports for route-based splitting
2. **React Optimization**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically
3. **Database**: Implement query batching and eager loading
4. **Images**: Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing

**Expected Improvements:**
- 40% faster initial page load
- 60% reduction in bundle size
- 3x faster database queries
- Better Core Web Vitals scores

**Security Strengths:**
✅ HTTPS enforcement
✅ Input validation on forms
✅ JWT token authentication
✅ CORS properly configured

**Security Concerns:**
⚠️ **Medium Risk**: API endpoints missing rate limiting
⚠️ **High Risk**: User uploads not properly validated
⚠️ **Critical**: Potential XSS in user-generated content

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
2. Add file type validation and scanning for uploads  
3. Sanitize all user input before rendering
4. Add Content Security Policy headers
5. Implement proper session management

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Regular dependency updates (npm audit)
- Implement logging and monitoring
- Add two-factor authentication
- Consider implementing OAuth with trusted providers

Looking at your current architecture, I'd recommend approaching this by:
1. Creating a new API endpoint in \`app/api/\`
2. Adding the corresponding UI components
3. Integrating with your existing state management

Would you like me to walk you through the implementation step by step?`,
    
    `I've analyzed your project structure and this is definitely achievable. Your TypeScript setup and component architecture make this straightforward to implement.

Here's what I found in your codebase that's relevant:
- Your API routes are well-structured for adding new endpoints
- Your component library has the necessary UI primitives
- Your state management can easily handle the new data flow

Let me know if you'd like specific code examples or help with the implementation!`,
    
    `Great question! Looking at your current implementation, I can see a few ways to approach this. Your codebase is well-organized with clear separation of concerns, which makes adding new features like this much easier.

Based on your existing patterns, I'd suggest:
1. Following your current API route structure
2. Using your established component patterns
3. Leveraging your existing TypeScript interfaces

Would you like me to provide a detailed implementation plan?`
