# Update Lambda Function with Enhanced Analysis

## Steps to Update Your Lambda Function:

1. **Go to AWS Lambda Console**
   - Navigate to your function: `enterprise-code-analyzer`

2. **Update the Function Code**
   - Click "Code" tab
   - Replace the entire code with the contents of `lambda-function-esm.js`
   - Or copy-paste the updated code

3. **Deploy the Changes**
   - Click "Deploy" button
   - Wait for deployment to complete

## What This Update Does:

✅ **Analyzes ALL files** - No 50 file limit
✅ **Supports ALL languages** - Python, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, etc.
✅ **Better pattern matching** - Functions, components, imports, types
✅ **Deeper analysis** - Like repositories page
✅ **More file types** - 25+ different file extensions
✅ **No artificial limits** - Processes entire repository

## Expected Results After Update:

- **More files analyzed** - Hundreds instead of just 50
- **Real code patterns** - Functions, components, imports
- **Multiple languages** - Not just JS/TS/MD files
- **Better insights** - Security, performance, state management
- **Comprehensive analysis** - Like professional code analysis tools

## Test After Update:
Run analysis on `facebook/react` and you should see:
- React components from `packages/react/`
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Import statements from various files
- Function definitions from core React code
- State management patterns
- API calls and configuration usage
