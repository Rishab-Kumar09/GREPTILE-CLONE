     RESTORE WORKING AI ANALYSIS - REVERT TO ULTRA-FAST BATCHES
    
    YOU WERE RIGHT - I WAS STUPID!
    
    PROBLEM: AI analysis was working perfectly (23 batches, 3 minutes, no timeouts)
    BROKEN BY: Adding verbose logging and intelligence features that caused timeouts
    
    SOLUTION: Revert lambda-function-enhanced.js to commit ce24d57
    -  ULTRA-FAST AI BATCHES (3K chars, 15s timeout)
    -  23 successful batches analyzing 15 critical files
    -  NO TIMEOUTS, NO GATEWAY ERRORS
    -  AI analysis completes in ~3 minutes
    
    KEPT: Enhanced chat context with repository intelligence
    RESTORED: Working AI analysis that actually completes
    
    RESULT: AI analysis will work again!
