# 🔍 ChatGPT Analysis Pattern Study

This directory contains detailed logs of how ChatGPT analyzes different types of files. The goal is to understand and document ChatGPT's testing patterns across:

- Different programming languages (JS, TS, Python, Java, etc.)
- Different types of code (Frontend, Backend, Libraries, etc.)
- Different architectures (Monolith, Microservices, etc.)

## 📊 Analysis Structure
Each analysis is stored in JSON format with:
- File metadata (language, type, size)
- ChatGPT's exact testing methodology
- Patterns and rules used
- Results and findings

## 🎯 Goal
By collecting and comparing these analyses, we can:
1. Identify common testing patterns
2. Understand language-specific checks
3. Document ChatGPT's analysis approach
4. Build our own static analysis tool based on findings
