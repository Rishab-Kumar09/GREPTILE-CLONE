This could lead to SQL injection if an attacker is able to control the input. The format and formatNamedParameters functions use the escape function, and are therefore also vulnerable.\n- PROOF: \n```\nval = val.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n```\nThis line only escapes single quotes, but does not handle other special characters that could be used in an SQL injection attack.\n- FIX: Use a library designed to prevent SQL injection by properly escaping all special characters and sequences.
