I started by examining the functions and patterns in the code, focusing on areas where user input is handled or where database queries are constructed.\n2. I analyzed each function in the code, looking for potential security vulnerabilities or code quality issues.\n3. I checked for SQL injection vulnerabilities, improper input validation, and unsafe data handling.\n4.

I found a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'format' and 'formatNamedParameters' functions. These functions replace placeholders in the SQL query string with user-provided values without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.\n2. This is a critical issue because SQL injection can lead to data loss, data corruption, or unauthorized access to data.\n3.
