What you checked for:\n   - I reviewed the code for hardcoded secrets, SQL injection vulnerabilities, command injection risks, resource leaks, and logic issues such as infinite loops and division by zero.\n   - I also looked for potential memory leaks and improper handling of user input.\n\n2. For SQL/Database code:\n   - I specifically checked for SQL injection vulnerabilities by identifying any direct user input used in SQL queries without parameterization.\n   - I also looked for any hardcoded database credentials and unsafe command executions.\n\n3. I validated potential issues by analyzing the context in which user input was handled and how sensitive information was managed.\n\n4. I determined severity based on the potential impact of each issue, considering factors like data exposure, application stability, and security risks.\n\n=== ANALYSIS END ===\n\nDETAILED FINDINGS:\n1. I discovered multiple critical issues, including hardcoded secrets, SQL injection vulnerabilities, command injection risks, resource leaks, and logic flaws such as infinite loops and division by zero risks.\n2. Each of these issues poses significant risks to security and application stability, making them critical to address.\n3. I am confident in the findings due to the clear presence of vulnerabilities and poor coding practices.\n4. Specific code examples illustrate the issues, such as hardcoded passwords and unsafe SQL query construction.\n\nFINAL RESULTS:\nThe code contains numerous critical issues that could lead to severe security vulnerabilities and application instability. Immediate remediation is necessary to protect sensitive information and ensure the application functions correctly.\n\nREPLICATION GUIDE:\n1. To replicate this analysis without using AI, manually review the code for patterns of hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, and command injection vulnerabilities.\n2. Implement regex patterns to identify hardcoded strings, such as `r'[\"\\'].*?[\"\\']'` for strings and `r'os\\.system\\('` for command execution.\n3. Use a step-by-step algorithm:\n   - Check for hardcoded secrets by scanning for assignment statements with sensitive keywords (e.g., \"password\", \"key\").\n   - Analyze SQL queries for direct user input without parameterization.\n   - Review command execution patterns for user input.\n   - Look for resource management issues by checking for open file handles without corresponding close statements.\n   - Identify infinite loops by checking for `while True` without exit conditions.\n4. Create a flowchart connecting checks for hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, command injection, resource leaks, and logic issues.\n5. Handle edge cases by ensuring checks account for variations in how sensitive information might be stored or accessed.\n\nOPTIMIZATION GUIDE:\n1. To avoid over-analysis, focus on patterns that are known to be risky, such as hardcoded credentials and direct user input in queries.\n2. Safe patterns to ignore include standard library imports and well-known secure practices like using environment variables.\n3. When handling files with no context, prioritize checks for resource management and sensitive information exposure.\n4. Use a confidence threshold of high for critical security issues and medium for logic and performance issues.\n5.

        "1. What you checked for:",
        "- I reviewed the code for hardcoded secrets, SQL injection vulnerabilities, command injection risks, resource leaks, and logic issues such as infinite loops and division by zero.",
        "- I also looked for potential memory leaks and improper handling of user input.",
        "2. For SQL/Database code:",
        "- I specifically checked for SQL injection vulnerabilities by identifying any direct user input used in SQL queries without parameterization.",
        "- I also looked for any hardcoded database credentials and unsafe command executions.",
        "3. I validated potential issues by analyzing the context in which user input was handled and how sensitive information was managed.",
        "4. I determined severity based on the potential impact of each issue, considering factors like data exposure, application stability, and security risks.",
        "=== ANALYSIS END ===",
        "DETAILED FINDINGS:",
        "1. I discovered multiple critical issues, including hardcoded secrets, SQL injection vulnerabilities, command injection risks, resource leaks, and logic flaws such as infinite loops and division by zero risks.",
        "2. Each of these issues poses significant risks to security and application stability, making them critical to address.",
        "3. I am confident in the findings due to the clear presence of vulnerabilities and poor coding practices.",
        "4. Specific code examples illustrate the issues, such as hardcoded passwords and unsafe SQL query construction.",
        "FINAL RESULTS:",
        "The code contains numerous critical issues that could lead to severe security vulnerabilities and application instability. Immediate remediation is necessary to protect sensitive information and ensure the application functions correctly.",
        "REPLICATION GUIDE:",
        "1. To replicate this analysis without using AI, manually review the code for patterns of hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, and command injection vulnerabilities.",
        "2. Implement regex patterns to identify hardcoded strings, such as `r'[\"\\'].*?[\"\\']'` for strings and `r'os\\.system\\('` for command execution.",
        "3. Use a step-by-step algorithm:",
        "- Check for hardcoded secrets by scanning for assignment statements with sensitive keywords (e.g., \"password\", \"key\").",
        "- Analyze SQL queries for direct user input without parameterization.",
        "- Review command execution patterns for user input.",
        "- Look for resource management issues by checking for open file handles without corresponding close statements.",
        "- Identify infinite loops by checking for `while True` without exit conditions.",
        "4. Create a flowchart connecting checks for hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, command injection, resource leaks, and logic issues.",
        "5. Handle edge cases by ensuring checks account for variations in how sensitive information might be stored or accessed.",
        "OPTIMIZATION GUIDE:",
        "1. To avoid over-analysis, focus on patterns that are known to be risky, such as hardcoded credentials and direct user input in queries.",
        "2. Safe patterns to ignore include standard library imports and well-known secure practices like using environment variables.",
        "3. When handling files with no context, prioritize checks for resource management and sensitive information exposure.",
        "4. Use a confidence threshold of high for critical security issues and medium for logic and performance issues.",
        "5. Prioritize analyzing files that handle user input or sensitive data first in a large repository.",
        "6. Skip checks for well-defined utility functions that do not handle sensitive data or user input if optimizing for speed and accuracy."
