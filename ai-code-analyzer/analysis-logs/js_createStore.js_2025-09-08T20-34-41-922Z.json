I would also focus on security-related patterns like input validation, error handling, and the use of third-party libraries.\n   - In this case, since the provided code is simply \"404: Not Found\", there are no functions or patterns to analyze.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Part of the Code**: \n   - Normally, I would break down the code into its components, examining each function and variable for potential vulnerabilities or inefficiencies. However, with the absence of actual code, this step is not applicable.\n\n3. **Specific Checks Performed**: \n   - I would typically check for common vulnerabilities such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), SQL Injection, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and insecure API calls. In this case, no checks can be performed due to the lack of code.\n\n4. **Validation of Potential Issues**: \n   - Normally, I would validate issues by running static analysis tools, conducting manual code reviews, and testing the application in a controlled environment. Again, this is not applicable here.\n\n5. **Criteria for Severity Determination**: \n   - I would assess the severity of issues based on factors like exploitability, impact on user data, and the potential for data breaches.
